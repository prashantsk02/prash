## Description
This webcrawler is created using Jsoup.

Given a starting URL â€“ say exmple.com - it should visit all pages within the domain, but not follow the links to external sites such as Google or Twitter.
The output should be a simple site map, showing links to other pages under the same domain, links to static content such as images, and to external URLs.
